The choice of `userId` was meant because we expect many users to listen to the same song, which makes `song` alone inefficient as a unique key. Meanwhile, we can't guarantee the users' names to be unique so `userId` was the best choice. Each partition is uniquely identified by `song` while `userId` was used to uniquely identify the rows within a partition to sort the data by the value of `userId`."
